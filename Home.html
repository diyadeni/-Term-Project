  <p> Welcome to my website! My name is Diyaden Ing. 
  I'm a CSIS student at Douglas College (New Westminster Campus). I was born in Cambodia and moved to Canada
  with my family in 2009. My interest for coding began when I was in grade 9. The I.T instructor of my school
  introduced the class to HTML programming. Web Development is an interesting and unique course and I would love 
  to explore more of it.
